Fertilizer Management and Soil Health

Balanced fertilizer application is essential for sustainable crop production. Soil testing is the foundation of good fertilizer management.

Soil Testing Importance:
- Determines nutrient status of soil
- Helps in calculating fertilizer requirements
- Prevents over-fertilization and nutrient imbalance
- Saves money and protects environment

Primary Nutrients (NPK):

Nitrogen (N):
- Functions: Promotes vegetative growth, chlorophyll formation
- Deficiency symptoms: Yellowing of older leaves, stunted growth
- Sources: Urea, ammonium sulfate, calcium ammonium nitrate
- Application: Split application during crop growth

Phosphorus (P):
- Functions: Root development, flowering, fruit formation
- Deficiency symptoms: Purple/red coloration, delayed maturity
- Sources: Single super phosphate, diammonium phosphate
- Application: Apply at planting time

Potassium (K):
- Functions: Disease resistance, water regulation, quality improvement
- Deficiency symptoms: Yellowing/browning of leaf margins
- Sources: Muriate of potash, sulfate of potash
- Application: Split application with nitrogen

Secondary Nutrients:
- Calcium: Cell wall formation, reduces soil acidity
- Magnesium: Chlorophyll component, enzyme activation
- Sulfur: Protein synthesis, oil formation

Micronutrients:
- Iron, Zinc, Manganese, Boron, Copper, Molybdenum
- Required in small quantities but equally important
- Deficiency often occurs in alkaline soils

General Fertilizer Recommendations:

Rice:
- N:P:K ratio 4:2:1
- Apply 25% N as basal, 50% at tillering, 25% at panicle initiation
- Zinc application recommended in deficient soils

Wheat:
- N:P:K ratio 4:2:1
- Apply full P and K at sowing, N in 2-3 splits
- First irrigation critical for nutrient uptake

Maize:
- N:P:K ratio 4:2:1.5
- Apply 25% N at sowing, 50% at knee-high stage, 25% at tasseling

Organic Fertilizers:
- Farmyard manure: 10-15 tonnes per hectare
- Compost: 5-10 tonnes per hectare
- Green manure: Incorporate legume crops before flowering
- Bio-fertilizers: Rhizobium, Azotobacter, PSB

Best Practices:
1. Always conduct soil test before fertilizer application
2. Apply fertilizers when soil has adequate moisture
3. Incorporate fertilizers into soil to reduce losses
4. Avoid application during windy conditions
5. Store fertilizers in dry, cool place
6. Never mix different fertilizers unless recommended

Timing of Application:
- Basal: At the time of sowing/planting
- Top dressing: During active growth period
- Foliar: During reproductive stage for quick correction

Signs of Over-fertilization:
- Excessive vegetative growth
- Delayed flowering/maturity
- Increased pest and disease incidence
- Salt burn on leaves
