Irrigation Management for Indian Agriculture

Proper irrigation management is crucial for crop productivity and water conservation. Here are key guidelines for different crops and seasons:

Winter Crops (Rabi):
- Wheat: Requires 4-6 irrigations during growth cycle. Critical stages are crown root initiation (20-25 days), tillering (40-45 days), jointing (60-65 days), flowering (85-90 days), and grain filling (105-110 days)
- Mustard: Needs 2-3 irrigations - first at 30-35 days, second at flowering, third at pod filling
- Chickpea: Generally requires 1-2 irrigations - one at pre-flowering and another at pod filling stage

Summer Crops:
- Rice: Keep 2-5 cm standing water during vegetative stage, intermittent irrigation during reproductive stage
- Sugarcane: Requires frequent irrigation every 7-10 days during active growth period

Irrigation Scheduling:
- Check soil moisture at 2-3 inch depth before watering
- Early morning (6-8 AM) is the best time for irrigation
- Avoid irrigation during hot afternoon (12-3 PM)
- Consider weather forecast before irrigation

Water-Saving Techniques:
- Drip irrigation can save 30-50% water
- Mulching reduces evaporation by 50-70%
- Furrow irrigation is suitable for row crops
- Sprinkler irrigation for uniform water distribution

Soil Moisture Assessment:
- Sandy soils: Water when top 6 inches become dry
- Clay soils: Water when top 4 inches become dry
- Loamy soils: Water when top 5 inches become dry

Signs of Water Stress:
- Wilting during cooler parts of day
- Yellowing of older leaves
- Reduced growth rate
- Early maturity

Monsoon Considerations:
- Reduce irrigation frequency during rainy season
- Ensure proper drainage to prevent waterlogging
- Monitor for fungal diseases in high humidity
